this is a help file for the disp_x_token module.

the module works by being hooked up in the main module.

for inputs it requires a 50MHZ clock, normally high reset signal, 
start signal and a 4 bit number to tell how many tokens to do.

as an output it gives a done signal when all tokens are dispenced and a
PWM to control the servos.

as parameters it takes a wait_cycle which dictates the number of Pulses to 
wait before moving the servo back to the start, and 2 postions in and out to be set to the reguired
postion for the servo.
